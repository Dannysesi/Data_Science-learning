If it is black, clean it with a brush and test again. \n Change The Spark Plug: If the car does not start after cleaning, then you will need to change the spark plug. It is not a costly component and can be changed without much expenditure. \n Consult A Mechanic: If the misfire happens even after replacing the spark plug, then we would recommend that you get your car checked by a skilled engine mechanic as the problem could be related to the cylinder or piston head."],
